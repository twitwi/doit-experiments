The goal of this repository is to:

- experiment with the [doit](http://pydoit.org/) automation tool
- ask for comments and improvements on how I did things
- provide/archive some typical patterns for myself

Quick folder index:

- get-unzip-and-transform/ tries to cleanly get and extract a zip and then transform all files that were in the zip
-  (can be ignored) raw-data-generator/ is just used for pre-generating things such as data.zip
